## Terms of Use

I made this web tool to help other GitKraken enthusiasts build really cool GitKraken themes. This will remain an open sourced project that I will 
do my best to maintain and add features as best as I can. 

## Feature Requests

Obviously, this is missing a ton of functionality and cool stuff so if you have an idea and this project interests you. Create an issue and lets discuss.
